                                We went on a nice walk to the several
                                overlooks of Niagra falls. The sound was
                                deafening, but the scenery was incredible.
                                Make sure to bring a poncho, otherwise you 
                                will get soaked.

                                I went on a structure that was at the base 
                                of one of the falls. You could stand 
                                underneath the falls and feel all the 
                                water pour on you. Needless to say, wear your
                                poncho.

                                This picture was taken at the base of the 
                                falls. The amount of water rushing right 
                                next to me was crazy. I was very glad that I 
                                had a good coat and a poncho, because the 
                                water was splashing everywhere.

                                I also got to take a boat ride out in the 
                                middle of the falls. It was really windy, 
                                and the mist was so heavy, it became 
                                difficult to see. Luckily, the boat ride 
                                provided us with ponchos, otherwise I 
                                would have been completely drenched.
